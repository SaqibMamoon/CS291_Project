For the charts/reports page you just click any button above the divide in any combination (please don't do more then 6, it will be a long wait) and it will display all the combinations in a graph.

For the tables tab you can add an entry or edit current entries, or clear all entries. Clear all entries is bottom right. Save the table is bottom left. Selection of current table is bottom middle. And then it's straight forward how to enter/edit entries. 

## Booking Menu
![Booking](https://github.com/efirdc/CS291_Project/blob/cory/booking.png?raw=true)

The booking menu allows you to create a booking for the currently active customer. When a customer logs into the system they will immediately enter the booking menu. Employees can also access this menu for any customer from the employee menu.

First you must select a start date for the booking, a pick up branch, and a drop off branch. The "Select Car" drop down will be populated with model names of cars that are available for pick up at that branch. The end date and cost of the booking are automatically determined based on the billing cycle, number of cycles, and rental price of the car. If a customer makes 3 bookings in the same year, a message will be displayed that they have received a gold star membership. An error message will be displayed if any field is not filled in or if the booking date is in the past.
