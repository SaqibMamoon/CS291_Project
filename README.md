## Booking Menu

The booking menu allows you to create a booking for the currently active customer. When a customer logs into the system they will immediately enter the booking menu. Employees can also access this menu for any customer from the employee menu.

First you must select a start date for the booking, a pick up branch, and a drop off branch. The "Select Car" drop down will be populated with model names of cars that are available for pick up at that branch. The end date and cost of the booking are automatically determined based on the billing cycle, number of cycles, and rental price of the car. If a customer makes 3 bookings in the same year, a message will be displayed that they have received a gold star membership. An error message will be displayed if any field is not filled in or if the booking date is in the past.
